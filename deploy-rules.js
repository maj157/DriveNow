==== FIREBASE RULES DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS ====

To deploy your new Firestore rules:

1. Install the Firebase CLI if you haven't already:
   npm install -g firebase-tools

2. Login to Firebase:
   firebase login

3. Initialize Firebase in this project (if not already done):
   firebase init

4. Deploy the Firestore rules:
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

Your Firestore rules will then be active, and admin users
will have the appropriate permissions.

NOTE: Make sure your user actually has the 'admin' role 
in your Firestore database's 'users' collection.
